Integrating EEG signal processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning; voila music therapy!

# Details

To measure, analyze and influence sentiment using music.  We are using EEG signal processing and sentiment analysis of various soundtracks to make song recommendations. By comparing the initial and final state of the user's mind, we can determine which tracks match certain moods. 

# Workflow

Train a system by analyzing EEG signals and songs a user listens to (maybe even faces). Gather enough data to verify when a user finds pleasure in the music. Use the system as a starting point to play mood changing music, always making sure that the user finds the music pleasurable.
